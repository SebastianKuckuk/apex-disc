# Accelerated Programming EXamples (APEX) - DIstributed Stencil Communication (DISC)

To be part of the [APEX collection](https://github.com/SebastianKuckuk/apex).

## Scope

Straight-forward Jacobi updates for an nD finite difference stencil discretization of Poisson's equation on patch-based grids.
The main aim is to provide a platform to benchmark different approaches to (distributed) parallelism.
